## Description
In this application, I build a team profile generator using Node.js and jest. The goal is to use a prompt to ask the user a series of questions on how to generate a team. They will first input their own information, as they are filling the role of the Manager. They will then be asked a series of questions regarding the employees they want to add. The questions are those such as whether to add an Engineer or Intern, or to simply finish generating their team and inputting the criteria required for each employee type (such as the school the intern went to). The profile page is then generated onto an HTML page where it is then displayed in a live server.

## Installation
-npm install inquirer
-npm install jest
-npm run tests: runs tests for Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern
-node index.js: runs the index.js and will generate the prompt in the terminal
